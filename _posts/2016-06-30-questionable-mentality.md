Why is it that so many coding challenges that are part of the developer job interview process are somewhat amorphous?  And more importantly, why are QUESTIONS regarding said coding challenges considered anathema?

I have found the instructions are often vague and/or leave numerous technical details unaccounted for.  I have also found that the companies that present the coding challenges are singularly unresponsive to questions meant to clarify the specs of the requested end-product.

What is WRONG with asking questions? When has anything EVER been built without the builders asking questions to clarify design points?  I mean E V E R.  Why am I as a job seeker supposed to be able to divine these answers from the Ether?

OK, you want me to format stream data for a database.  What FIELDS would you like in the database?  What data should make up key fields, and what would you like me to index?  How is the data to be retrieved?  That MIGHT actually guide my design and implementation choices on the back-end.

Why do hiring managers or tech managers or dev team leads assume that I am not worth the time and effort because I ask QUESTIONS?  Wouldn't they rather have a careful and considerate employee who takes the time to THINK about an issue and make sure they have a proper understanding of it rather than an arrogant hot-shot rushing FULL SPEED AHEAD with no regard to the quality of the end product?

I understand the notion of crafting an MVP ASAP, but if you're looking for a kitchen marinade syringe and someone builds you a fuel injector don't you think you're going to be a little bit dissatisfied with the result?  Yes, they both express a fluid from one end, but just because they do essentially the same thing does NOT make them interchangeable products.

There are many reasons why Architects spend so much time hanging around construction sites.  Not the least of which is to answer questions about the designs and make last minute adjustments to the designs for the builders.  

There are REASONS why Agile design methodologies came to exist, reasons why daily scrums and regular feedback enable efficient turnaround times.  Being able to ask questions, make changes on the fly, and exchange frequent status updates and feedback makes software development flexible and... need I say it? ...AGILE.

So please don't drop me from consideration for having the audacity to ASK QUESTIONS.  I'm doing what I have been trained to do.  Thinking critically, breaking the challenge down into its simplest components, attempting to put them together in the most logical and error-free manner.  Asking for clarification when the directions can be interpreted multiple ways should not disqualify me.

Asking questions is a valid skill and asking the RIGHT questions is a VALUABLE skill.

I do both, and that should be considered an asset, not a liability.
