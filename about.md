Once upon a time when I worked in IT land "amarkpark" was a folder I made to temporarily "park" some files on a remote server... Eventually I had such folders on all my branch DCs and the folder had been shared and perhaps synchronized or set to roam. "amarkpark" contained essential tools of my trade: installers, batch files, drivers, patches, scripts, executables... It was my technical Bag-of-Holding&#8482;. 

I got so used to browsing to or running "amarkpark" that I decided it would make a good domain name. Because, among other things, I might want to park files or content or tools (Oh My!)... and let's face it, it's catchy! I also loved that it was wordplay using my username and the word Park. Park can be a verb meaning "to place temporarily" OR a noun meaning "a place to PLAY". That appealed to me.

[AMP](http://amarkpark.com/) stands for A Mark Park

In the first Rails App I created I updated a logo with a tagline: "An AMPed Web App" and a new identity was born.

Amp evokes... energy, electricity, current, and the act of souping something up. The word is charged with meaning. (Pun fully intended.) I love it.

I tag [code and comments](https://github.com/amarkpark/) with "~AMP". I use an Ampersand symbol too... because it's a code joke.  At least to ME.

Perhaps this page is suppose to be "About" ME. The particular geek behind the &. Trust me, it IS.

~AMP
